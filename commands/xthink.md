# xthink - Extended Analysis Mode

## Purpose
Enter deep thinking mode for complex problem solving and architectural decisions.

## When to Use
- Complex architectural decisions
- Performance optimization problems
- Security vulnerability analysis
- Algorithm design challenges
- System integration planning
- Protocol/plugin architecture design

## Process

### 1. Problem Analysis
Enter extended thinking to:
- Break down the problem systematically
- Identify constraints and requirements
- Map dependencies and interactions
- Consider multiple solution approaches
- Evaluate trade-offs

### 2. Solution Design
- Propose 2-3 viable approaches
- Compare pros/cons of each
- Recommend optimal solution
- Identify risks and mitigations
- Plan implementation strategy

### 3. Validation Questions
Ask targeted questions to validate approach:
- "Does this align with your constraints?"
- "Any concerns with this approach?"
- "Should we prioritize X over Y?"

## Output Format
```markdown
# Analysis: [Problem]

## Problem Understanding
- Core challenge
- Key constraints
- Success criteria

## Considered Approaches
### Option 1: [Name]
- **Pros**: ...
- **Cons**: ...
- **Complexity**: S/M/L

### Option 2: [Name]
- **Pros**: ...
- **Cons**: ...
- **Complexity**: S/M/L

## Recommendation
[Chosen approach with rationale]

## Implementation Plan
1. High-level steps
2. Key decisions needed
3. Risk mitigations

## Open Questions
- Items needing clarification

Save as `sandbox/analysis/[topic]-analysis.md`

## Key Principles
- Think deeply before proposing
- Consider edge cases thoroughly
- Balance ideal vs pragmatic
- Document reasoning clearly
- Seek validation on approach
